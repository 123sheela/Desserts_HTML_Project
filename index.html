    <p>Kaju Katli is a classic Indian delicacy prepared with cashew nuts, sugar, cardamom powder, and ghee butter,
       defined by its diamond form.This delectable treat is typically wrapped in edible silver foil,representing
       luxury and consumer appreciation. It is traditionally consumed during the Diwali festival, but it also 
       makes a lovely gift for friends and family on other occasions. For example, during Ganesh Chaturthi, 
       a celebration commemorating Ganesha's birth, kaju katli, is frequently made.</p>

    <p>While you might think the cheesecake got its start in New York, its origins date back to ancient Greece
       and the island of Samos. Anthropologists have found cheese molds there that date back to circa 2000 
       B.C.E. and the first recipe for Greek cheesecake is credited to writer Athenaeus in 230 A.D. But it 
       was Americans who added cream cheese to the cake in 1872. A New York dairy farmer accidentally created 
       what we now know as Philadelphia Cream Cheese when he was trying to re-create French Neufchatel. 
       While there are seemingly unlimited variations of cheesecake, New York style cheesecake uses cream
       cheese along with eggs, cream, sugar and usually a graham cracker crust.It's served plain with no 
       other ingredients or toppings..</p>

    <p>Apple pies or tarts date all the way back to Europe in the 14th century. The first apple pie recipes are 
       from 1390, and they used honey in place of the seldom-used sugar. In the 1700s, the pie became pretty 
       popular in the United Kingdom and was brought over to the new American colonies.Apple pie was regularly 
       found in American cookbooks by the 18th century, but the famous ala mode version, topped with vanilla ice cream, didn't come into fashion until the 19th century in New York.</p>

    <p>The birthplace of ice cream isn't certain, but food historians generally credit it to the Chinese and
       the flavored ices they enjoyed as far back as 3000 B.C.E. Marco Polo is believed to be the man responsible for 
       bringing the idea to Italy, where the modern ice cream we enjoy today was born in the 17th century. 
       The first ice cream recipe in the United States is thought to be from the 1792 cookbook 
       "The New Art of Cookery, According to the Present Practice." </p>

    <p><br>Brownies can also be tailor-made to suit your taste buds. The traditional chocolate variety is a
           classic, enjoyable option, but some aspiring chefs prefer to include other ingredients to add 
           some extra zing to the mix. For example, cream cheese, peanut butter or chocolate chips, coffee, 
           white chocolate and icing are all popular add-ins. Their versatility alone is what makes brownies
           one of Americans' favorite desserts.</br></p></hr>
